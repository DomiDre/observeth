#Simple script to read abi and bin from file created by solc --bin --abi
#And to copy it to a .js readable format.
#Just copy solidity_clean to $GOPATH/src/
#Go into the folder and run 
go build solidity_clean.go
#and 
go install
#which should move solidity_clean to your $GOPATH/bin folder
#$GOPATH/go/bin should be in your $PATH and thus solidity_clean callable from bash
